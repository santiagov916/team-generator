  ## Description

  this is an object-oriented- program, tested by using jest! Enter node index inside of the command and you will be prompted to enter a few questions about you and your team. Once all team members are added, you will be given a page to generate all members and their specific info! This is great for anyone who needs a quick printout of their team info!
